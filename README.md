# Alexis Project Portfolio
This file is about my porfolio project.
It is my first take on this assignment that I barely done.
Doing the best and effort to apply all techniques with all 
like flexbox, media quieres, and css variables. This still 
needs to be consider more further updates but can be done 
almost flawlessly. I am enjoy working on this project and
keep up working with this websites with more updates. I hope 
you enjoy my presentation there. I actually like to hear some feedback of this of I can 
improve my coding skills to be more unquie awewsome.
This is just some of the techniques I used to create an 
advanced css professional portfolio page.
